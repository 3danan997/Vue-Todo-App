# Todo App

This is an app I developed after watching crash-courses about **Vue.js**. I've implemented it with help from this tutorial ([tutorial link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhjxAP1hFuI&t=613s&pp=ygUPdnVlIGpzIHRvZG8gYXBw)).

## Purpose  
This project was created during my **third semester** while following a Vue.js crash course. It was a learning opportunity to understand Vue.js and web development best practices and to help me to dive in with a team to design a bigger website using laravel and vue.js.
